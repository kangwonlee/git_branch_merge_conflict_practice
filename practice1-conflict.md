## Git merge conflict example

* This file will show `git merge` conflict

## Conflict expected here

* Becalues this section would be different from the `master` branch.
* Please remove three lines of inequalities and equalities.
* Then `git add` to let `git` know you have resolve the conflict.
* `git commit` to create a *merge commit*.

## This part will be fine

* This section would have the same content.
* So the merge would succeed without conflict.
