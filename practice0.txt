## Git branch practice

* This file is to help practicing git branch & merge
* Also would try to show an example of merge conflict

## Merge example

* This is a new line
* `git log --graph --all --oneline --decorate` will show the branch graph
* `git diff merge-this` will show differences 
* Run `git checkout merge-this` to check
* Please merge this line and a few lines below
* Switch back to master using `git checkout master`
* Run `git merge --no-ff merge-this` to merge
